# User Data Isolation Fixes

## Problem Summary
The app had serious data management issues where user data was not properly isolated. Tasks completed by one user would appear as completed for all users, and there was no proper user context management.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded User Data in Dashboard**
- **Problem**: Dashboard component had hardcoded user data instead of using authenticated user's data
- **Fix**: Created a proper UserContext provider and updated dashboard to use actual user data from authentication

### 2. **Missing User Context Management**
- **Problem**: No centralized user state management across components
- **Fix**: Created `UserContext.tsx` with:
  - Centralized user state management
  - Authentication status tracking
  - Proper loading states
  - Logout functionality

### 3. **Inconsistent Authentication Flow**
- **Problem**: Components were making separate authentication calls and not sharing user state
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated all components to use the UserContext
  - Removed duplicate authentication logic
  - Ensured consistent user state across the app

### 4. **Data Leakage in API Queries**
- **Problem**: Query keys and API calls didn't properly include user ID for data isolation
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated all queries to use `user?.id` from context
  - Ensured proper query invalidation with correct user ID
  - Fixed mutation callbacks to use authenticated user ID

### 5. **Missing Authentication Middleware**
- **Problem**: Backend routes didn't have proper authentication and authorization checks
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive middleware:
  - `requireAuth`: Ensures user is authenticated
  - `validateUserAccess`: Ensures users can only access their own data
  - Applied to all user-specific routes

### 6. **Session Management Issues**
- **Problem**: Session data wasn't properly validated for user-specific operations
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated routes to use `req.session.userId` instead of accepting userId from request body
  - Added proper session validation
  - Ensured all user operations are tied to the authenticated session

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `client/src/contexts/UserContext.tsx` - **NEW**: User context provider
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added UserProvider wrapper
- `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Updated to use user context, removed hardcoded data
- `client/src/pages/anxiety-track.tsx` - Updated to use user context

### Backend
- `server/routes.ts` - Added authentication middleware and user access validation

## Security Improvements

1. **User Data Isolation**: Each user can only access their own data
2. **Session Validation**: All operations require valid authentication
3. **Access Control**: Users cannot access other users' data even with direct API calls
4. **Data Integrity**: All user-specific operations are tied to the authenticated session

## Testing

Created `test-user-isolation.js` to verify:
- Users have unique IDs
- Module data is isolated per user
- Dashboard data is isolated per user
- Unauthorized access is properly blocked
- Session management works correctly

## How to Test

1. Start the application
2. Run the test script: `node test-user-isolation.js`
3. Create multiple user accounts and verify data isolation
4. Try accessing other users' data (should be blocked)

## Key Changes Summary

- ✅ **User Context**: Centralized user state management
- ✅ **Authentication**: Proper session-based authentication
- ✅ **Data Isolation**: Each user sees only their own data
- ✅ **Security**: Unauthorized access is blocked
- ✅ **Consistency**: All components use the same user context
- ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for data isolation

The app now properly manages user data with complete isolation between users. Each user will only see and interact with their own data, and the system prevents unauthorized access to other users' information.
